Canny
=====


A MATLAB implementation of the classic Canny Edge Detector


###### Overview ######

"Canny" is a set of MATLAB scripts and functions which implement the Canny edge Detector for grayscale images. It was implemented as the 1st programming
project of CMSC 733, the University of Maryland's Graduate Computer Vision course, in Fall 2014. All code was authored in MATLAB. 


###### Dependencies ######

The code has been tested on MATLAB R2014b, on both Windows and Linux 64-bit. You will need the Image Processing toolbox to run the code.


###### Code structure #####

All .m files have detailed comments that can guide the reader through understanding what the code does. The "images/" directory contains images that can be used to 
test the algorithm.


###### Running #######

Running the script "canny" will load three images from the "images/" directory, perform edge detection and visualize the results.
